Create a multilingual static website in English and Dutch using this example: https://github.com/nohaelgendy/en-ar-demo
Create a VTT subtitles file for the included video both in English and in Dutch.
Check the syntax of the VTT after creation to make sure it conforms to the requirements
After that, summarize the video, extract the important topics, questions and answers.
Create the needed HTML file according to the multilingual static website project with a YouTube embed for the video with the VTT file displayed on top of the video. On the left side create tabbed navigation for the topics, selecting them gives an overview of the questions and answers within that topic, the video also jumps to that part of the video. The questions and answers also contain time codes that navigate to that section of the video. Double check the JavaScript code for the YouTube navigation after you have created it so you know it works.
The YouTube ID for the video to use in is: __fUX5Z2JVU so link to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__fUX5Z2JVU
Use the included HTML file as an example for the layout and the JavaScript used to overlay the subtitels. It contains a selection box for subtitle language, change that to a selection box for the language of the full page.
Also make it so that it works on different screen sizes, I want to be able to view it on mobile devices (smartphones) and bigger screens.
