What advanced digital learning aids
to get for your students?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.500
The Ministry of Education has allocated financial resources to schools for two purposes:
to prevent the digital divide and for digital learning aids.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
And right now, we are in front of a school that successfully uses advanced digital learning aids.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.500
If you are school principals, ICT coordinators, or teachers who are still deciding,
we have prepared this video to inspire you. Let's take a look.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Physics lesson.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
What is a winch?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.000
So this was the well, here was a kind of wheel, on that wheel is a rope,
into the well, and here is a crank, it turns it. Yes?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500
That's a winch. And then we attach a rope and we will lift some object.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.000
In this lesson, we are using the SAM Labs Classroom Kit. It's a kit that contains various types of sensors
that very easily connect via Bluetooth to an iPad.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:48.500
And with this kit, we will try to create a special winch, with which we will lift
an object from the ground onto the table, and we will calculate the work and power of the motor.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.500
The Ministry allocated financial resources to schools. It did so in the simplest way,
using the Education Act and so-called other financial resources.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tell me, how did you deal with the purpose of these financial resources?
What digital learning aids were you buying, and what decided your choice?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Well, I hope we dealt with the purpose correctly. We were buying digital learning aids
that we, for example, already had experience with up to that point.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.500
We are quite used to working in teams at our school. So the team of informatics teachers
discussed and decided which digital learning aids they would want to use in informatics lessons.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:06.000
And the team of teachers who teach educational subjects chose digital learning aids
based on which ones could support their subject. To give an example,
English teachers found a robot that can speak.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Or rather, the child can record their voice into it.
And the robot can repeat what the child said with a robotic voice.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.000
Hello! How are you?
(Robot: Hello! How are you?)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.500
(Robot: Good morning, how are you? Hello, how are you?)

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.000
You are the ICT coordinator at this school. Tell me, how did you coordinate the selection of digital learning aids?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:57.500
We have been using digital learning aids for a number of years. We gradually update them,
select new ones, based on sharing with our colleagues, whether in Facebook groups,
or we have a school team of ICT coordinators and informatics subject teachers.
Each of us attends several training sessions. If it proves useful there, we apply it in various subjects.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.500
Tell me, which digital learning aid do you like the most, and in which subject do you use it?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:26.500
I lead the Robotics and Programming subject, where we primarily focus on 3D printing,
which is very attractive for children. They can design their own things there,
which they then use at home, like various cable holders, starting from the simplest ones,
up to, if colleagues tell us they need some teaching aid, we design and print it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.500
And can you tell me what students enjoy the most? What brings them joy and where can they
apply their experience from lessons elsewhere than at school?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:05:01.000
For example, in 3D printing, we focused on making clocks. We designed alarm clocks, bought mechanisms for the back,
so you can see them in certain classrooms. Students took them home. Or for Christmas,
we printed Christmas trees. For the sports day, which we have every year,
we printed tokens that students received, then collected, and based on the count, they received some rewards.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
You also mentioned using 3D printing in mathematics. What do you produce there?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
In mathematics, various rulers, protractors, aids for Hejný's method of mathematics,
various puzzles, blocks, brain teasers, and so on.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:23.500
How do you use digital learning aids in other subjects, not just those focused on informatics?
And I know you teach physics, so I'll ask you about physics.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I'm happy to talk about that. For example, we use Micro:bit. With Micro:bit, we create
a thermometer. Students can design the thermometer in some way,
and here collaboration with, for example, an art teacher is offered.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:06:00.500
Which teaching subject do you also enjoy where you use digital learning aids?
Well, it's English, which is another subject I teach. And in English,
we also use, for example, Micro:bit, because it can display text in some way,
but more often we use the Dash robot, which can speak.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
(Robot: What time is it? Sorry, I'm late.)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Informatics lesson.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:16.500
Your task will be to use the robot, which you already know, you've had it in your hands.
It's called Codey Rocky. And it works on an application called Makeblock.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.500
You have everything written on that worksheet.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:36.000
Your task will be, you'll have two parts. In the first part, using the robot and block programming,
you will program it so that the robot performs rectilinear motion and then curvilinear motion.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Where did this inspiration come from? Who showed you the way, for example?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:07:06.500
Among other things, we also found information on the Ministry of Education's website,
on edu.cz, "Digitalizujeme školu" (We are digitizing the school). We were glad. Tell me if you also used the IT Guru,
there's a link to it there, or do you have enough experts that you managed on your own? How does it work for you?
Well, we know some IT Gurus personally, so it wasn't directly an IT Guru service,
but it was a "friend on the phone" service.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Financial resources from the National Recovery Plan must be drawn
in accordance with the conditions, purpose, and criteria
published in Gazette 01/2022 or in the Call.
